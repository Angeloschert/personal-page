I had a one-year coop internship at Ericsson from May 2020 to April 2021 where I worked as the 4G/5G software development\nEngineer, and developed some web-based data manipulation tools to reflect and visualize the performance of 5G new radio devices. Later I started working at IBM in two different teams focusing on Cloud development and Cognos Analytics respectively.\n\n# Currently\n\nCurrently I am working as a software engineer at IBM in the Cognos Analytics (CA) - Modelling Service (Moser) team. Cognos Analytics is a web-based BI analytics software built on multiple Java microservices, and I am responsible for data module abstraction, optimization on datasource handling and some UI upgrades. Recently CA is on the way to the Cloud and I am involved in its transition to DaaS and deployments on Kubernetes.\n\n# Some history\n\nI started school at University of Toronto in 2018 and now I have graduated around 1 month ago. I am a passionate developer with strong background knowledge and empirical experience in both progressive web development and deep learning. I completed a few personal projects that manifest some practical implications, and I am always avid in learning new things and making progress in my career path. For May 2020 to April 2021, I did my one-year internship at Ericsson as the 4G/5G Software Development Engineer, and I spent most of my time in Tools Team developing and refining software components and supportive deliverables that extensively helped the baseband team with device stats reporting/monitoring and data pipeline manufacturing. During my internship, I also learned about the basics of distributed system and in-depth hands-on stuff on SpringBoot framework.\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I love travelling around the world and collect the special items that are distinctive to some landmarks.\n- I've been to ~ 60 cities/places around many countries, some of which I have good experience with, and many of which I would like to revisit.\n- In 2016, I visited: many cities in China including Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqin, and some places in Israel like Haifa, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv.\n- In 2017, I visited: cities in Paris, Austria, Germany, London/Leeds in the U.K, Taiwan.\n- In 2018, I visited: Toronto, Montreal in Canada, Greece, Venice.\n- In 2019, I visited: Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Halifax, Yellow Knife in Canada, Urumqi, Lhasa, Sanya in China.\n- In 2020, I barely traveled to any places due to Covid-19.
