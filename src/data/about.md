# Intro

I graduated from University of Toronto, St George with an honors Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics. I had a one-year coop internship at Ericsson from May 2020 to April 2021 where I worked as the 4G/5G software development
Engineer, and developed some web-based data manipulation tools to reflect and visualize the performance of 5G new radio devices. Later I started working at IBM in two different teams focusing on Cloud development and Cognos Analytics respectively.

# Currently

Currently I am working as a software engineer at IBM in the Cognos Analytics (CA) - Modelling Service (Moser) team. Cognos Analytics is a web-based BI analytics software built on multiple Java microservices, and I am responsible for data module abstraction, optimization on datasource handling and some UI upgrades. Recently CA is on the way to the Cloud and I am involved in its transition to DaaS and deployments on Kubernetes.

# Some history

I started school at University of Toronto in 2018 and now I have graduated around 1 month ago. I am a passionate developer with strong background knowledge and empirical experience in both progressive web development and deep learning. I completed a few personal projects that manifest some practical implications, and I am always avid in learning new things and making progress in my career path. For May 2020 to April 2021, I did my one-year internship at Ericsson as the 4G/5G Software Development Engineer, and I spent most of my time in Tools Team developing and refining software components and supportive deliverables that extensively helped the baseband team with device stats reporting/monitoring and data pipeline manufacturing. During my internship, I also learned about the basics of distributed system and in-depth hands-on stuff on SpringBoot framework.
